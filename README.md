# Filament-Calculator
A tool meant to be helpful with multiple processes when 3d printing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program allows you to calculate how much it will cost to print a part, and mow much to charge someone given a percentage to upcharge by.
This program also allows you to track how much filament is left on each spool, and track how much you make from selling 3D printed parts, as well as how much you buy of filament and how much you go through.
